# Vocal-Source-Separator
Vocal Source Separator is a software that takes an audio file as input and can recognise vocals from the it and converts them into a text file.

Speech is a complex phenomenon. It is always useful to have speech in the form of text to study. Lengthy audio files containing music and important speech only at certain points is difficult to comprehend as audio but suppose we have a system which is separating the vocal/speech part into a text file, then it will be so much easier to study the important information. This can be seen from the following example. Suppose a person had an hour and a half audio recording from a hand-over meeting with his former co-worker. He remembered that he mentioned something at some point, but was dreading listening through 1.5-hour audio file to find it. By running the recording through this system, he can quickly find the needed keywords. This idea is used as a motivation for this project.

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
Following are the technologies used in this project:
1. Backend was developed using python language.
2. Google cloud speech API
3. Python modules like Numpy, Librosa, Matplotlibâ€™s pyplot, speech recognition, PyQt5
4. Software required- Qt Designer (For GUI)
